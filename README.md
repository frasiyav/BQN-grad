# BQN-grad
An experiment implementing reverse-mode auto-differentiation, and a (very slow) neural network in [BQN](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN).

Inspired by [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and Andrej Karpathy's exellent [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) on backpropagation.

The qmnist dataset used to test can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/qmnist).
